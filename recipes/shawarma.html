    <h2 class="title lesser">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and pat chicken dry(make sure to keep all surfaces clean). Season with the salt, coriander, thyme, black pepper, red pepper, grated garlic, grated ginger and oil. set it aside for an hour or more</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Meanwhile, in a none stick skillet or frying pan, sear the chicken on both sides; after which you pour in about ¼ cup of water or meat stock and transfer into the oven and cover to let it cook. (<em>If your skillet is not oven proof, simply transfer the chicken into an oven tray with the water or stock and let it cook in the oven until it is done and the juices have run clear</em>). Let the meat rest for a few minutes before you cut or shred</li>
        <li>Slice (<em>at this point, toss the cut up or shredded chicken in the yaji powder</em>)</li>
        <li>Chop all your vegetables and set aside together in a bowl</li>
        <li>Make the mix for the dressing by whisking it together and set aside</li>
        <li>You may warm the flat bread for 10 seconds if you want; then gradually assemble the veggies and chicken on to one end of the flat bread. Roll and tuck in the ends. You may wrap with a foil wrapper and leave in the oven to keep warm. You may also sear it on a none stick pan. This gives the roll a sweet crunch</li>
        <li>If using pita, slice it open down the middle and tuck all the veggies, chicken, and sauce into the Pita's pocket and enjoy!</li>
